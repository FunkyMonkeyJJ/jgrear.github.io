# My Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a recent graduate of Bowling Green State University, where I earned a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science in April 2023. This site serves as a shortcut to my resume and showcases some of my projects.

## About Me

I am currently working for AskVTI in Toledo, Ohio. I am always looking to broaden my horizons and strive to be a better person and software developer. I really want to travel the world, so any opportunities that would allow that would be a dream!

I enjoy playing video games, cooking new foods, and posing theoretical questions about foreign concepts. One of my favorite concepts is that nothing that humans have created really exists, such as a number line and counting in base 10. For example, amount exists but numbers do not. Therefore, 0.3333 + 0.3333 + 0.3333 doesn't equal 1, ever; it will only ever get closer. Rounding is a concept created for the use of whole numbers, but the question is posed with floating point numbers, thus rounding shouldn't be used.

## Projects

### Minecraft Plugins
#### Java / Kotlin

Minecraft was the gateway to my desire to learn programming. I started to learn the inner-machinations of the game and created plugins a couple years before I started college at Wright State back in 2019. I took my knowledge from my classes and tried to apply it towards my Minecraft plugins that I displayed on my personal server that I ran. College eventually got in the way and I had to shutdown my server after a few years.

Some of the plugins that I created were:
- DungeonMaze: Manually created mazes with customizable traps and rewards.
  - [Dungeon Maze](https://github.com/john-grear/dungeon-maze)
- EnderShift: Obsidian block layout that allowed you to teleport vertically and across far distances to other shift points in view.
- Crates: General purpose crate plugin with GUI for easy customizing of crate drops.
  - [Pandemonium Crates](https://github.com/john-grear/pandamonium-crates)
- Parkour: General purpose parkour plugin with checkpoints and rewards.
- Games: Customizable minigame plugin to allow for easy creation of new minigames, extending the base functionality of all minigames to future ones (timers, start/end, location allocation, win/loss count, etc.).
  - [Pandemonium Games](https://github.com/john-grear/pandamonium-games)

The plugins without links were never uploaded to github as I was just starting out in software development and was working alone.

### Dungeons of Doom App
#### Kotlin / Android

This was a group project for my Usability Engineering course at BGSU in Spring 2022. For this project we were focusing on increasing usability instead of functionality. The purpose of this app was to allow people to create custom D&D characters with every aspect of character creation available to them (i.e. custom class creation, image selection / custom image upload, custom lore, etc.). They could then save different profiles for sets of characters that belong to different campaigns. Because this app had a lot of customization, it would even work for tabletop RPG games similar to D&D like Pathfinder, Call of Cthulhu, etc.

### BGSU Internship Website
#### PHP / Laravel

This was my capstone project. I and two others took an existing Laravel PHP website and fixed it up so that BGSU can use it for future computer science / software engineering internship registration and submission. The project was in shambles when we received it as the capstone group before us was not good at programming. For this project we learned how to use PHP and the Laravel framework. We worked on it for the whole semester, following Agile procedures. We added new pages, new functionality, and would have finished it with a couple more weeks, but finding time in college is difficult. It should be used by BGSU after the summer 2023 capstone course.

When BGSU starts using it, it could be viewed on there site, but I do not own the code from the repo. As of April 2023, it is not used yet.
